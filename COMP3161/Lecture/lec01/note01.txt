A mole is disturbing a row of five graves. The mole is always
underneath one of the graves.

1. Each day, we may attempt to catch the mole by
   digging up a grave. If we found the mole, we win;
   otherwise, we put the grave back in order and go to sleep.
2. Each night, the mole must move from its current position to an
   adjacent grave.

Find a sequence of digs that is guaranteed to find the mole.



=============================================

A winning sequence is 2 3 4 2 3 4.

The key thing is to track the set of positions the mole could be in.

{1,2,3,4,5}
 2
{1,3,4,5}
then, the mole moves
{2,3,4,5}

{2,4,5}
mole moves:
