During ex.type lecture we talked about positive and negative
 occurrences of type variables.

This applies to subtyping as follows:
- Type variables that occur positively can be treated covariantly
- Type variables that occur negatively can be treated contravariantly


Type variables to the right of a function arrow,
  or underneath any other construct, are positive
Type variables to the left of a function arrow are negative


 data Foo a = Foo (a -> Bool) -> Bool
                   ^ that one can be covariant,
                     because it occurs double-negatively
                     aka positively
