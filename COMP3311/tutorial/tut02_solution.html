We have adopted (and violated) several conventions in the SQL schemas in these questions.
<ul>
<li>
We have suggested that all tables derived from entities should have
pluralised names (e.g Student in ER, Student in relational box-and-arrows,
Students in SQL). Our examples and solutions don't always do this.
</li>
<li>
We have suggested not using all upper-case for SQL keywords.
Many of our solutions use upper-case keywords.
</li>
<li>
We have suggested that primary and foreign keys always be defined after
the attributes, despite the fact that there are more compact ways of
defining them. We sometimes use the compact versions of key definitions.
</li>
</ul>
Note that all of the above are style conventions. Not doing them will not
make an SQL "program" incorrect, but mixing them in a single <tt>*.sql</tt>
file is bad style. We would, however, prefer that you adopt our suggestions.

<br><li>
<p>
Why is it useful to first do an ER design and then convert this
into a relational schema?
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
Because ...
<ul>
<li> allows the designer to initially concentrate on an abstract view of data
</li><li> allows the designer to initially concentrate on an abstract view of relationships
</li><li> no need to initially worry about concrete representation details
</li><li> no need to initially worry about fine-grained details of constraints
</li><li> the <q>structural</q> parts of the mapping are straightforward
</li><li> new information (concrete data types, constraints, FKs) must be added <br>
	for the relational model, but this is easier if other design work already done
</li></ul>
</div>

<br></li><li>
<p>
Convert each of the following ER design fragments into
a relational data model expressed as a box-and-arrow diagram:

<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>Relational models for the three Teacher-Teaches-Subject scenarios:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> <br> <img src="./tut02_solution_files/teaches1-rel.png">

</li><li> <br> <img src="./tut02_solution_files/teaches3-rel.png">
</li></ol>
<p>
In (a), we implement the relationship via a foreign key in
the relation that has only one associated entity.
</p>
<p>
In (c), we place the foreign key in the relation
that totally participates in the relationship, so as to minimise
wasted space.
</p>
</div>

<br></li><li>
<p>
In the mapping from the ER model to the relational model,
there are three different ways to map class hierarchies
(ER, OO, single-table).
Show each of them by giving the mapping for the following
class hierarchy:
</p>

<p>
Now consider a variation on the above class hierarchy where
the sub-classes are disjoint.
Show the three possible mappings for the class hierarchy and
discuss how effectively they represent the semantics of the
disjoint sub-classes:

<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p> Relational mappings for a class hierarchy: </p>
<img src="./tut02_solution_files/classes1-rel.png">
<p>
Note: the ER and OO mappings cannot represent the disjoint
constraint. There is nothing in the data model to prevent
an object occurring in multiple sub-classes.
In the single-table mapping, however, we can add an extra
attribute which indicates which sub-class each tuple belongs
to; this forces each tuple to belong to just a single
sub-class.
However, this still doesn't prevent a tuple from e.g.
containing a value for attribute <tt>b</tt> when it also
has a value of 'S' for the <tt>subClass</tt> attribute.
In SQL, we can write table constraints to prevent such
situations.
Preventing sub-class overlap in the ER or OO models in
SQL requires us to use global constraints, typically
implemented as triggers.

</pre>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
No difference for a single attribute primary key (as above).
</p>
<p>
But you cannot define a multi-attribute primary key inline, e.g.
</p>
<pre>-- this does not work               -- define it like this

create table R (                    create table R (
   a integer primary key,              a integer,
   b integer primary key,              b integer,
   ...                                 ...

<p>
Discuss suitable SQL representations for each of the following
attributes, including additional domain constraints where relevant:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> <p>people's names</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
How to represent names, depends on how they're going to be used.
If we need to sort people by family name, then we'd either need
to store them as a single string in the format
<code>"</code><i>familyName</i><code>,</code><i>givenNames</i><code>"</code>
or stored as two separate attributes, one for each component of the
name.
If stored as a single string, <code>varchar(40)</code> would be ok
to hold all but the longest human names. If stored as two separate
strings, each individual component would probably need to hold up
to 30 characters, e.g.
</p><pre>givenName    varchar(30),
familyNames  varchar(30),
</pre>
In some contexts, you might even want to store two versions of the
name: the official one (perhaps as above), and another one which
gives a single string to tell how the user would like their name
to appear when displayed, e.g.
<pre>showname     varchar(50),
</pre>
(to avoid those horrible middle names that you don't want anybody
to know about :-)
</div>
</li><li> <p>addresses</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
As for names, addresses could be broken into components such as
street, town, state, country, postal-code, e.g.
</p>
<pre>street  varchar(30),
town    varchar(30),
state   varchar(30),
country varchar(30),
</pre>
or simply done as a single string, but longer than a person's name.
<pre>address  varchar(80),
</pre>
If <code>country</code> was available as a separate table (which
may be plausible in some contexts), then a foreign key reference
to a country identifier could be used.
<pre>street  varchar(30),
town    varchar(30),
state   varchar(30),
country integer references Country(id),
</pre>
</div>
</li><li> <p>ages</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
It is probably better to use date-of-birth rather than age.
Why? because age changes over time, while date-of-birth is
fixed and there are typically operations available to compute
age, given the date-of-birth.
However, if anyone was to insist on having an age attribute,
then it would be useful to use an integer value with
additional common-sense constraints, e.g.
</p>
<pre>age  integer check (age &gt; 0 and age &lt; 150)
</pre>
</div>
</li><li> <p>dollar values</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
For monetary values, we typically need (for display, at least),
an arbtrary number of total digits, with two digits after the
decimal point. In SQL, this could be done as:
</p><pre>value  numeric(20,2),
</pre>
Alternatively, it could simply be represented as a floating
point number, e.g.
<pre>value  float,
</pre>
Some database systems (e.g. PostgreSQL) have special (non-standard)
types for handling monetary values, e.g.
<pre>value  money,
</pre>
Values of this type are essentially floating point numbers with
the additional property that they can be read and written using
a format like <code>$1234.56</code>
<p>
If some application did not want to allow negative monetary
values, it would need to add an additional constraint to
enforce this:
</p><pre>value  money check (value &gt;= 0.00)
</pre>
</div>
</li><li> <p>masses of material</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
Generally, a floating point value would be the most suitable.
Since you cannot have negative mass, it would be useful to add
an additional constraint. It is also useful to document the
units of measurement, although this can only be done as an
SQL comment, e.g.
</p>
<pre>quantity  float check (quantity &gt;= 0.0)  -- kilos
</pre>
</div>
</li></ol>
</li>

<br><li>
<p>
In many real PostgreSQL schemas, you will see definitions like
</p>
<pre>create table R (
   id    <span class="red">serial</span>,
   name  text,
   d_o_b date,
   ...
   primary key (id)
);
</pre>
<ol type="a">
<li> What is the effect of the <tt>serial</tt> declaration? </li>
<li> How would you make use of it when inserting tuples? </li>
<li> How would you reference <tt>R.id</tt> as a foreign key? </li>
</ol>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
It creates an integer attribute and a <em>sequence</em>.
The sequence generates, suprise, a sequence of consecutive (unique)
integer values.
Every time you insert a new tuple and don't give a value for the
<tt>id</tt> attribute,
the sequence supplies a new one and increments itself.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
You need to use the <tt>returning</tt> clause to capture
the generated value, e.g.
</p>
<pre>insert into R(name,d_o_b) values ('John','1972-02-28') returning id;
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Since the <tt>serial</tt> attribute contains an integer value,
you would reference it as e.g.
</p><pre>fk integer references R(id)
</pre>
<p>
Defining the <tt>fk</tt> attribute as <tt>serial</tt> actually
works, but generates a useless sequence as a side-effect.

Give reasons for all choices of domain types.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
Convert CompanyListing entity into an SQL <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> definition:
<p>
</p><pre>CREATE TABLE CompanyListing
(
	name         char(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	sharePrice   numeric(6,2),
	netWorth     numeric(20,2)
);
</pre>
<p>
Stock-market listings typically use 3-4 character abbreviations
for company names, so a fixed-length character string is ok.
Since share prices are money values, using numeric values with
two decimal places (for cents) would be suitable. Individual
share prices are rarely more than $1000.00, so we use a field
with 6 digits, including 2 decimal places. The nett worth of
a listed company is likely to be very large, so we allow for
up to 20 digits. Note that both of these allow only integer
values of cents. Since the stock market probably requires more
precision, then a <code>float</code> value (or allowing more
digits after the decimal point) might be more appropriate.
PostgreSQL provides a <code>money</code> data type which uses
floating point and has the added advantage of displaying the
field in a format like <code>$999.99</code>

Convert Person entity into SQL <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> definition:

(
	familyName      varchar(30),
	givenName       varchar(30),
	initial         char(1),
	streetNumber    integer,
	streetName      varchar(40),
	suburb          varchar(40),
	birthday        date,
	PRIMARY KEY     (familyName,givenName,initial)
);
</pre>
<p>
The choice of a three-part name is tricky. The family-name and
given-name parts are pretty much as described above. However,
the initial creates a problem. It is part of the key, and so
the above definition requires it to be provided, even though
not everyone is going to have a middle initial. It ought to
remain part of the key, however, so that we can distinguish
between people called <q>John A. Smith</q> and <q>John B. Smith</q>.
Since no part of the key is allowed to be NULL, we need to adopt
some convention for people with no initials; a plausible approach
would to use a single space character (i.e. <tt>' '</tt>).
If we need to deal with addresses like <q>1a Smith Street</q>, then
we'd need to change the <code>number</code> attribute to a string
type.
Since all DBMSs have a <tt>date</tt> type, along with functions
for extracting the components, we may as well collapse the
components of the <tt>birthday</tt> attribute into a single
field of <tt>date</tt> type.

<p>
<i>Which elements of the E/R design do not appear in the relational version?</i>
</p>
<p>
All of the elements appear. The translation is a straightforward mapping
because we have an N:M relationship. Each entity becomes a table; the
relationship becomes a table. Attributes in the ER model become attributes
in the relational model. The only information we need to add are specific
domain definitions for the attributes; we've chosen <q>reasonable</q>
domains.

At a syntactic level, all of entities, relationships and attributes
are explicitly represented in the relational schema.
At a semantic level, the total participation constraints on
<code>Person</code> and <code>Car</code> in the <code>Owns</code>
relation are not represented, so that there could be people in the
database who do not own a car, and cars that are not owned by
anyone.

Note that it is not possible to express these constraints in standard
SQL. They would need to be implemented by e.g. stored trigger procedures.

<i>Which elements of the E/R design do not appear in the relational version?</i>
</p><p>
At a syntactic level, the multi-valued attributes from the E/R design
do not appear directly in the relational model, but are replaced by
tuples in the <code>TeamColours</code> and <code>FavColours</code>
tables.
</p>
<p>
At a semantic level,
it doesn't capture the total participation of the <code>Team</code>
entity in the <code>PlaysFor</code> relationship. While all players
have to play for a team, the diagram does not enforce that each team
must have at least one player who plays for it (except indirectly via
the fact that it has to have a captain).
</p>
<p>
It also doesn't require that a team has at least one colour
 or that a fan has
any favourite colours. Of course, the E/R diagram doesn't imply this
either (non-key attributes are not required to have a value), but if
it did state this, the relational model as given could not capture it.
</p>
<p>
The above SQL schema is simple, but doesn't actually load because of
the mutual interdependence of Player and Team. To fix this, you would
need something like the following:
</p>
<pre>-- create Team without the foreign key and then add it once Player exists

CREATE TABLE Teams
(
	name      varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
	captain   varchar(40) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Players
(
	name      varchar(40) PRIMARY KEY,
	team      varchar(50) NOT NULL REFERENCES Teams(name)
);
ALTER TABLE Teams ADD FOREIGN KEY (captain) REFERENCES Players(name);

-- alternatively, move the captain foreign key to the Player table
--   which is allowed because it's a 1:1 mapping
-- this isn't as efficient because players who are not captain will
--   have a null value for the captain foreign key

CREATE TABLE Team
(
	name      varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY
);
CREATE TABLE Player
(
	name      varchar(40) PRIMARY KEY,
	team      varchar(50) NOT NULL REFERENCES Teams(name)
	captain   varchar(50) REFERENCES Teams(name)
);

The reason why the foreign key constraint is added later is because
there is a mutually recursive pair of foreign key references between
<tt>Employee</tt> and <tt>Department</tt>. We can't add the foreign
key reference until the relevant table exists, so we need to create
one table first, without the foreign key, add the other table (which
refers to the first table), and then add the foreign key reference
from the first table to the second table.
<p>
The <tt>not null</tt> constraints on <tt>Department.manager</tt>,
<tt>Employee.worksFor</tt> and <tt>Depdendent.ssn</tt> implement
the total participation requirements from the ER model.

<i>Which elements of the ER design do not appear in the relational version?</i>
</p><p>
The relational model cannot represent (in standard SQL), the total
participation constraints for patients (i.e. every patient must be
treated by at least one doctor). This would need to be enforced via
e.g. a stored trigger procedure.
It also cannot represent the total participation constraint on the
relationship WorksFor between pharmacists and pharmacies (i.e. every
pharmacy must have at least one pharmacist working in it).
