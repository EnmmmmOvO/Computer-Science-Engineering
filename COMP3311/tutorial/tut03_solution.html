<p>
Consider the following data model for a
a business organisation and its employees:
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./tut03_solution_files/schema.png"></center>
<p></p>
<p>
Employees are uniquely indentified by an id (<tt>eid</tt>), and other
obvious information (name,age,...) is recorded about each employee.
An employee may work in several departments, with the percentage of
time spent in each department being recorded in the <tt>WorksIn</tt>
relation (as a number in the range 0.0-1.0, with 1.0 representing
100%).
The percentages for a given employee may not sum to one if the employee
only works part-time in the organisation.
Departments are also uniquely identified by an id (<tt>did</tt>),
along with other relevant information, including the id of the
employee who manages the department.
</p><p>
Based on the ER design and the above considerations, here is a
relational schema to represent this scenario:
</p><pre>create table Employees (
      eid     integer,
      ename   text,
      age     integer,
      salary  real,
      primary key (eid)
);
create table Departments (
      did     integer,
      dname   text,
      budget  real,
      manager integer references Employees(eid),
      primary key (did)
);
create table WorksIn (
      eid     integer references Employees(eid),
      did     integer references Departments(did),
      percent real,
      primary key (eid,did)
);
</pre>
<p>
Answer each of the following questions for this schema ...
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Does the order of table declarations above matter?
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
Yes. The order matters. We can not insert a Department tuple until there is an Employee tuple available to be the manager of the department.
We cannot also insert any WorksIn tuple until you have both the Employee tuple and the Department tuple where the employee works.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
A new government initiative to get more young people into work
cuts the salary levels of all workers under 25 by 20%.
Write an SQL statement to implement this policy change.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
SQL statement to reduce pay for people under 25 by 20%:
</p>
<pre>update Employees
set    salary = salary * 0.8
where  age &lt; 25;
</pre>
<p>
A straightforward applicatiom of the SQL <tt>UPDATE</tt> statement.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
The company has several years of growth and high profits, and
considers that the Sales department is primarily responsible for this.
Write an SQL statement to give all employees in the Sales department
a 10% pay rise.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
SQL statement to give Sales employees a 10% pay rise:
</p>
<pre>update Employees e
set    e.salary = e.salary * 1.10
where  eid in
           (select eid
            from   Departments d, WorksIn w
            where  d.dname = 'Sales' and d.did = w.did
           );
</pre>
<p>
This query requires that we know which department an employee works
for before updating their pay. The only information we have in the
<tt>Employees</tt> relation to help with this is the employee id.
Thus the subquery gives a list of ids for all employees working
in the Sales department.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
Add a constraint to the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements above
to ensure that every department must have a manager.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<pre>   create table Departments (
      did       integer,
      dname     varchar(20),
      budget    real,
      manager   integer not null,
      primary key (did),
      foreign key (manager) references Employees(eid)
   );
</pre>
<p>
Change the definition of <tt>Departments</tt> to ensure that
the foreign key <tt>manager</tt> is not null.
The foreign key constraint already ensures that the value
must be a primary key in the <tt>Employees</tt> relation
but, without the <tt>NOT NULL</tt> declaration, a foreign
key value is allowed to be null.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
Add a constraint to the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements above
to ensure that no-one is paid less than the minimum wage of $15,000.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
This is a straightforward example of a single-attribute constraint.
It is effectively a constraint on the domain of the <tt>salary</tt>
attribute. In fact, it would been sensible to have an initial
constraint to ensure that the <tt>salary</tt> was at least positive.
A similar constraint should probably be applied to the <tt>percent</tt>
attribute in the <tt>WorksIn</tt> relation.
</p>
<pre>create table Employees (
   eid       integer,
   ename     varchar(30),
   age       integer,
   salary    real check (salary &gt;= 15000),
   primary key (eid)
);
</pre>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
Add a constraint to the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements above
to ensure that no employee can be committed for more than 100%
of his/her time.
Note that the SQL standard allows queries to be used in constraints,
even though DBMSs don't implement this (for performance reasons).
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
We have expressed this as a tuple-level constraint, even though
it's really a constraint on the <tt>eid</tt> attribute.
Note the use of scoping in the sub-query: the <tt>eid</tt> refers
to the id of the employee that is being inserted or modified,
while <tt>w.eid</tt> is bound by the tuple variable in the subquery.
The subquery itself computes the total <tt>percent</tt> that the
employee <tt>eid</tt> works.
</p>
<p>
This query is valid according to Ullman/Widom's description of the
SQL2 standard.
However, neither PostgreSQL nor Oracle supports subqueries in
<tt>CHECK</tt> conditions.
The condition can only be an expression involving the attributes in
the updated row.
</p>
<pre>create table WorksIn (
   eid         integer,
   did         integer,
   percent    real,
   primary key (eid,did),
   foreign key (eid) references Employees(eid),
   foreign key (did) references Departments(did)
   constraint  MaxFullTimeCheck
               check (1.00 &gt;= (select sum(w.percent)
                               from   WorksIn w
                               where  w.eid = eid)
                      )
);
</pre>
<p>
In most relational database management systems, the constraint
checking required here would need to be implemented via a trigger.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
Add a constraint to the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements above
to ensure that a manager works 100% of the time in the department
that he/she manages.
Note that the SQL standard allows queries to be used in constraints,
even though DBMSs don't implement this (for performance reasons).
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
We have expressed this as a tuple-level constraint, even though
it's really a constraint on the <tt>manager</tt> attribute.
</p>
<pre>create table Departments (
   did         integer,
   dname       varchar(20),
   budget      real,
   manager     integer,
   primary key (did),
   foreign key (manager) references Employees(eid)
   constraint  FullTimeManager
               check (1.0 = (select w.percent
                             from   WorksIn w
                             where  w.eid = manager)
                     )
);
</pre>
<p>
As in the previous question, this kind of constraint is allowed by
the SQL standard, but DBMSs typically don't implement cross-table
constraints like this; a trigger is required and the check has to
be programmed in the trigger.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
When an employee is removed from the database, it makes sense to also
delete all of the records that show which departments he/she works for.
Modify the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements above to ensure that this occurs.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
The <tt>ON DELETE CASCADE</tt> clause ensures that
when the <tt>Employees</tt> record for <tt>eid</tt> is removed,
then any <tt>WorksIn</tt> tuples that refer to <tt>eid</tt> are also removed.
</p>
<pre>create table WorksIn (
   eid         integer,
   did         integer,
   percent    real,
   primary key (eid,did),
   foreign key (eid) references Employees(eid) on delete cascade,
   foreign key (did) references Departments(did)
);
</pre>
<p>
Of course, this immediately reaises the issue of references to the
<tt>Departments</tt> relation; this is considered in the next question.
</p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
When a manager leaves the company, there may be a period
before a new manager is appointed for a department.
Modify the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements above to allow for this.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>
If the department has no manager, we indicate this by putting
a value of <tt>NULL</tt> for the <tt>manager</tt> field.
However, in one of the questions above, we added a NOT NULL
contraint to ensure that every department <em>does</em> have a manager.
To solve this question, we need to remove that constraint.
</p>
<p>
An alternative would be to always appoint a temporary manager,
which could be accomplished via an <tt>UPDATE</tt> statement, e.g.
</p>
<pre>update department set manager = <i>SomeEID</i> where did = <i>OurDeptID</i>;
</pre>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
Consider the deletion of a department from a database based on this schema.
What are the options for dealing with referential integrity
between <tt>Departments</tt> and <tt>WorksIn</tt>? For each option,
describe the required behaviour in SQL.
</p>
<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
Three possible approaches to referential integrity between 
between <tt>Departments</tt> and <tt>WorksIn</tt>:
<ol type="a">
<p></p><li>
Disallow the deletion of a <tt>Departments</tt> tuple if any
<tt>Works</tt> tuple refers to it.
This is the default behaviour, which would result from
the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> definition in the previous question.
<p></p></li><li>
When a <tt>Departments</tt> tuple is deleted, also delete all
<tt>WorksIn</tt> tuples that refer to it.
This requires adding an <tt>ON DELETE CASCADE</tt> clause to
the definition of <tt>WorksIn</tt>.
<pre>create table WorksIn (
   eid     integer,
   did     integer,
   percent real,
   primary key (eid,did),
   foreign key (eid) references Employees(eid) on delete cascade,
   foreign key (did) references Departments(did) on delete cascade
);
</pre>
In this solution, we've added the same functionality to the <tt>eid</tt>
field as well (see previous question).
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li>
For every <tt>WorksIn</tt> tuple that refers to the deleted department,
set the <tt>did</tt> field to the department id of some existing
'default' department.
Unfortunately, Oracle doesn't appear to implement this functionality.
If it did, the definition of <tt>WorksIn</tt> would change to:
<pre>create table WorksIn (
   eid     integer,
   did     integer default 1,
   percent real,
   primary key (eid,did),
   foreign key (eid) references Employees(eid) on delete cascade,
   foreign key (did) references Departments(did) on delete set default
);
</pre>
</li></ol>
<p></p>
</div>

</li><li>
<p>
For each of the possible cases in the previous question, show how deletion
of the Engineering department would affect the following database:
</p>

<div style="color:#000099;"><p><b>Answer:</b></p>
