</ul>
<b>General Instructions:</b>

<li> Questions may be answered in any order**.
<li> All questions must be submitted using <tt>give</tt> or Webcms3

<li> You can submit questions multiple times
<li> <b>Do not leave submissions to the last minute</b>

<b>End-of-Exam <b>Instructions:</b></b>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
If you believe that insufficient information has been provided to answer <br>
a given question, then you should write any assumptions that you think are <br>
necessary to complete the question and continue work from there. If the <br>
assumptions are reasonable, you can still obtain full marks for the question.
</p>
<p>
Note that marks are awarded for your working, not just for getting the <br>
correct final answer. If you get an incorrect final answer in one part of<br>
a question and use it in a later part of that question, it is still possible <br>
to achieve full marks for the later part if all working is correct.
</p>
<p>
For the prac questions, you can only receive full marks for a
<br> correctly-working program that loads/executes with no warnings. In all
<br> other cases, you receive partial-marks based on how close the program
<br> is to being correct. Submitting the supplied template is worth zero marks.
