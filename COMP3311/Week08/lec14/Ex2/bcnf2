Produce BCNF schema for real-estate example
R(P#, When, Address, Notes, S#, naMe, Carreg)


R = PWANSMC
fds = {P->A, S->MC, PW->SN}
key = PW    (PW+ = PWANSMC)


problem: P->A
fix: PWNSMC and PA

PA has only 2 attrs => BCNF


PWNSMC
fds = { S->MC, PW->SN }
key = PW

problem: S->MC
fix: SMC SWNP


SMC
fds = { S -> MC }
key = S

is in BCNF


PA* SMC* SWNP


SWNP 
fds = { PW->SN }
key = PW

is in BCNF


Final BCNF schema: PA SMC PWSN

PA = property table
SMC = staff table
PWSN = visits table
