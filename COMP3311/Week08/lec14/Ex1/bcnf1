Produce a BCNF decomposition of R(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) 
---------

R = ABCDEFGH
fds = { ABH->C, A->DE, BGH->F, F->ADH, BH->GE }
key = BH 

problem: A->DE, does not have the whole key on the LHS
fix: decomposition to R01 = ABCFGH and  R02 = ADE


R02 = ADE
fds = { A->DE }
key = A

no problem: R02 is in BCNF


R01 = ABCFGH
fds = { ABH->C, BGH->F, F->AH, BH->G }
key = BH

problem: F->AH , does not have the whole key on the LHS
fix: decompose to  R03 = BCFG  and  R04 = AFH


R03 = BCFG
fds = { }

no problem: there are no relevant FDs, so it's in BCNF


R04 = AFH
fds = { F->AH }
key = F

no problem: R04 is in BCNF
