    "\n",
    "Recall from that the Perceptron is a mistake-driven algorithm - it continues to update so long as it makes mistakes on the data. In the linearly separable setting, where can separate the data exactly with a linear separator, the algorithm is always guaranteed to terminate. If however the data is not linearly separable, the algorithm will never terminate. In this case, we might still want to learn a linear classifier that achieves low error (classifies most of the points correctly), and instead of looking at a mistake-driven algorithm, we look instead to a loss-based algorithm. In this section, we introduce learning linear classifiers via gradient descent. You should view this section of the lab as a precursor to learning in multilayer perceptrons (Neural Networks) via Backpropagation. This extension is known as the linear unit, it is basically a one-node neural network."

    "So far so good, we now have an algorithm that can give us something useful even when the data is not linearly separable. This is important since in practice we cannot hope to achieve zero error. One problem however is that in order to compute the gradient at each step, we need to run over the entire data set, which can be computationally infeasible. This brings us to the idea of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The idea behind SGD is very simple, instead of computing the true gradient by summing over the entire dataset, we instead estimate the gradient by looking at the gradient on a single observation. In other words, we update the weight vector after each observation."

    "At this point, you should be comfortable with the two concepts covered so far: 1. Perceptrons and 2. Gradient Descent. These are the two basic building blocks for neural networks, also referred to as Multi-layer percetrpons. The idea is to chain together perceptrons to be able to learn very complex decision surfaces (as opposed to just linear decision surfaces in the case of the standard perceptron). Once we chain perceptrons together however, how do we learn the weights? We do so via Backpropagation, which at its core is an algorithm that implements the chain rule from calculus. Recall that the chain rule comes up any time we have a composition of functions. For example, consider two functions $g_1(x) = e^x$ and $g_2(x)=x^2-3$, then we can compose these functions:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is essentially one big composition of functions, let's see why. Assume we have a $D$ layer neural network, and assume that the $i$-th layer has $n_i$ many units (or perceptrons), which can be different from layer to layer. The $j$-th perceptron in layer $i$ can therefore be represented by its weight vector $w^{ij}$ and its bias term $b^{ij}$. Instead of keeping track of all these vectors, we combine all the weights in a single layer into a single weight matrix, $W_i$, where each row of the matrix corresponds to the weights of a perceptron. Similarly, we combine all bias terms into a single vector $b_i$ (See the diagram below). To see why this is a composition, we can write the forward step of a NN as follows:\n",

    "In other words, we set the input $x$ to be output of the zero-th layer, and the output of the $i$-th layer is the element-wise sigmoid of the matrix product $W_{i-1} f_i + b_{i-1}$. What is this product? Recall from above that the product $W f$ returns a vector where each element is the dot product $\\langle w_i, f\\rangle$, where $w_i$ is the $i$-th row of $W$, i.e. the weights of the $i$-th perceptron/unit in the corresponding layer. Adding $b$ adds the bias, and the sigmoid is applied element-wise. This output then becomes the input of the next layer, and so on.\n",

We are dealing with MNIST, which are $28 \\times 28$ arrays (images), and so we have $28 \\times 28 = 784$ features. Therefore, the first layer (fully connected layer fc1) needs to have input dimension equal to 784. The output dimension can be anything, and I chose 100 arbitrarily. The second fully connected layer needs to have the same input dimension as the previous output dimension. Finally, since we have 10 classes, the output dimension of the last fully connected layer, in this case fc2, must be 10.\n",
