We will dive deeper into the bias-variance decomposition, and then work through detailed examples of Bagging and Adaptive Boosting, two algorithms that have become central to modern day machine learning. In each section, the goal will be to illustrate the concept both mathematically and then through code, and then we follow up with a short explanation of existing implementations that you should use in practice. It is important to understand how these algorithms work and so you are strongly encouraged to try to write simple implementations of these algorithms in Python, even if we do not end up using these in practice.\n",

To give a concrete example, suppose we are interested in estimating the average WAM of students in COMP9417, but we only have access to the WAM of a small subset of 22 randomly sampled students. The population here is all students in the course, and we must infer information about the true mean using only information about a small subset. \n",

    "### Interpretation - An important point\n",
    "An important question arises here: what does it mean to take an expectation (or variance) of an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$? How do we compute these values? For the purpose of this lab, we will side-step the proper mathematical definitions and try to answer this question in a more intuitive sense. We can think of our dataset $D$ as being just one of infinitely many datasets. Let's imagine that we have access to a black-box $B$ that we can query datasets from. We label these datasets: $D_1,D_2,\\dots, D_{\\infty}$, and for simplicity we assume that each dataset consists of the same number $n$ of samples. For clarity, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "D_1 &= \\{ X^{(1)}_1, X^{(1)}_2,\\dots,X^{(1)}_n \\} \\\\\n",
    "D_2 &= \\{ X^{(2)}_1, X^{(2)}_2,\\dots,X^{(2)}_n\\}\\\\\n",
    "D_3 &= \\{ X^{(3)}_1, X^{(3)}_2,\\dots,X^{(3)}_n\\}\\\\\n",
    "&  \\vdots\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume that we have chosen an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$. This estimator is a function of the dataset, so for each dataset, we can compute a new estimate. For example, if we wish to use the sample mean, then our estimate for each dataset would just be the sample-mean of each dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\hat{\\theta}_1 &= \\overline{X}_1 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{(1)}\\\\\n",
    "\\hat{\\theta}_2 &= \\overline{X}_2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{(2)}\\\\\n",
    "&  \\vdots\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. Now, we can think of the quantity $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\theta}]$ as being the average value of $\\hat{\\theta}$ over an infinite number of datasets. Similarly, we can think of $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})$ as the variance of $\\hat{\\theta}$ over an infinite number of datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a purely theoretical construction because we do not have access to a black-box $B$ that allows us to generate multiple datasets (in fact we will usually only have access to a single dataset), and secondly even if we did have access to $B$, we cannot sample an infinite number of datasets. This theoretical construction does however help us understand the benefits of different estimators and has led to the proposal of many important algorithms in machine learning that have had great empirical success."

    "### Bias-Variance for Learning Functions\n",
    "Up to this point, you should have understood the basic concepts underlying the bias-variance decomposition. We now tie this back into the machine learning framework. In a general (supervised) learning problem, we have access to a dataset $D$ which consists not only of feature vectors $X$, but also response values $y$, so that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = \\{(x_1,y_1),\\dots,(x_n, y_n)\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there exists some true (but unobservable) function $f$ that takes as input a feature vector $X$ and outputs a response $y$. We will also assume that the observed responses are corrupted by some additive noise. In other words, our assumption is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = f(x) + \\epsilon, \\qquad \\epsilon \\sim (0,\\sigma^2),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the notation $\\epsilon \\sim (0,\\sigma^2)$ means that $\\epsilon$ is a random variable with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$. One way to think about $\\epsilon$ is that it represents measurement error. For example, if we are measuring temperature on a given day using a thermometer, then our measurement might consist of the `true` temperature, $f(x)$, plus some noise due to the usage of a cheap theormometer. The most common assumption is that $\\epsilon$ is normally distributed, so we write: $\\epsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the goal of learning is to use the data $D$ to find an estimate of $f$, which we call $\\hat{f}$, so that $f$ and $\\hat{f}$ are as close as possible in some sense. One common way to do this is to learn a $\\hat{f}$ that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between $y$ and $\\hat{f}$. So far in this course, we have seen many ways of computing such an estimate $\\hat{f}$, for example, linear regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, etc. It turns out that regardless of how you choose to construct your estimate, there exists a decomposition of the MSE (the expected squared error of $\\hat{f}$ on a previously unseen example, i.e. test MSE), called the Bias Variance Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E} [(y- \\hat{f}(x))^2] = \\left ( \\text{Bias}(\\hat{f}(x)) \\right)^2 + \\text{Var}(\\hat{f}(x)) + \\sigma^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where as before, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Bias}(\\hat{f}(x)) = \\mathbb{E} [\\hat{f}(x)] - f(x).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the MSE of $\\hat{f}$ may be decomposed into a sum of three terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Squared) Bias: As discussed earlier, bias captures how far an estimate is from its target. Intuitively, simple algorithms (i.e. those with few parameters, such as linear models) will have high bias, since the 'true' function $f$ is rarely linear). We will see that models with low flexibility (linear models) tend to have high bias, and those with high flexibility (neural nets will have low bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: this captures how sensitive the learning method is to changes in the dataset. i.e. given two datasets $D_1$, $D_2$, how different are the corresonding estimates $\\hat{f}_1(x)$ and $\\hat{f}_2(x)$? We will see that flexible learning algorithms, such as neural nets, will have high variance. Intuitively, since neural nets are so powerful, they can fit pretty much any decision surface, so estimates on different datasets can vary greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $\\sigma^2$: this is called the irreducible error, and since our responses contain noise, this is the error we have to live with in our predictions, regardless of the learning algorithm we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand why these factors contribute to the overall test error. A learning algorithm with high bias is unlikely to be able to fit the true function, and so will do poorly when asked to make a prediction on a new test point (underfitting). A learning algorithm with high variance will have a lot of flexibility, and so will fit the training data very well, but this does not necessarily mean it will be able to generalise well (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is a trade-off between bias and variance. That is, learning algorithms that have low bias will tend to have high variance, and vice versa. In machine learning, we wish to find models that minimise MSE, and so we have to choose models that achieve the right balance between these two competing criteria."

The problem is that for different datasets, the models end up fitting the noise in the data. The high variance comes from the fact that for different datasets, we can get wildly different models. So there is a tradeoff here, which is known as the bias variance decomposition.

The idea is simple: instead of focusing on changing the learning algorithm (Decision Trees) in this case, we instead focus on the way the learning algorithm is fit. Given a (single) dataset $D = \\{(x_1,c_1),\\dots,(x_n,c_n)\\} $, where $x_i$ is the feature vector, and $c_i$ is the cluster label, we create $K$ bootstrap samples from this dataset, called $B_1,\\dots,B_K$, each of size $m$. A bootstrap sample is simply a new dataset randomly sampled (with replacement) from the original dataset. We then fit a decision tree to each bootstrap sample, resulting in a total of $K$ models, denote them by $h_1,\\dots, h_K$. Then, our Bagging classifier, $C$, on a new point $x^*$ simply returns:\n",

    "In other words, given a new test point, each of the $K$ models returns a predicted class, and the ensemble classifier returns the majority vote. Think back to our initial discussion of the blackbox data generating process - the idea behind bootstrapping is somewhat trying to approximate this process by randomly sampling to create datasets. You can also think of this algorithm as utilising the wisdom of crowds: on their own each model (seeing a limited dataset) might overfit or predict poorly, but the combination of many models avoids this, and gives us very stable results since we now rely on majority of models to return a particular prediction."

    "### Feature Bagging\n",
    "So far, we have seen one type of randomization, namely that of randomizing across samples to create our bootstrap samples. Another important type of randomization is randomization across features (Random Forests implement both types of randomization). We now describe what it means to randomize across features. Assume that the inputs $x$ are $p$ dimensional vectors, so that we have $p$ features in total. Instead of training a base learner in $p$-dimensional space, we randomly pick a subset of $s < p$ features, and train the base classifier on just those. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have $p=10$ features, and $s=3$, we would randomly pick a subset of 3 features to look at, and train a decision tree on this reduced $3$ dimensional problem. We can view this as feature-bagging, as opposed to the sample-bagging we saw before. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of randomization is to make the resulting predictors (trained base classifiers) as independent of each other as possible, so that we get an overall reduction in variance. If only sample-bagging is performed, there is still a risk that all models will give more weight to the same features (those that seem important for this particular dataset), and so the trained classifiers end up being quite correlated. Randomizing features ensures that this does not happen.\n",
