 * Reads in a maze from the given file. The file must be formatted as

 *     The first line must begin with two integers:
 *     1. The height of the maze (H)
 *     2. The width of the maze (W)
 *
 *     The next `H` lines must contain an ASCII representation of the
 *     maze, with a # representing a wall cell and a space representing
 *     a path cell. Each of these lines should contain `W` of these
 *     characters - additional characters will be ignored.
 *
 *     The next line must begin with two integers:
 *     1. The 0-indexed row number of the starting cell
 *     2. The 0-indexed column number of the starting cell
 *     Additionally, the starting cell must not be a wall cell.
 *
 *     The next line must begin with two integers:
 *     1. The 0-indexed row number of the exit cell
 *     2. The 0-indexed column number of the exit cell
 *     Additionally, the exit cell must not be a wall cell.
 *
 *     The rest of the file may contain anything, such as comments.
 *
 * Returns the maze if it was read successfully, or NULL otherwise.
