Question 4

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.
    I think heap is suitable, because when we want to add new item at end of queue or delete from the queue, the time complexity id O(1),
    and if we need move the new item into correct position, heap's time complexity is O(log2n). Compare with other method, they need to s
    earch for correct position and when some node add or delte the position will spend more time or more memeory, the time complexity is 
    also larger than O(log2n). Therefore, heap have more advantage than the others  for priority queue.
