Which hash collision method would be most appropriate in this scenario? Summarise the way this particular method works, and use it to justify your answer.

I think the best approach is to Separate Chaining because the number of keys 
to be added is greater than the number of indexes, so it is better to insert 
the contents of the same key into the list branch of the corresponding key.
