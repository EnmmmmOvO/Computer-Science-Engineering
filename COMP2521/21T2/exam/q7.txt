What is the best and worst case time complexity for the function above?

For m, the best and worst case time complexity are all O(m), the best and worst case depends on the number of m;

For n, the best and worst case time complexity are all O(n) for loops that assign random values. For insertion function,
the best case is the array in ascending order, the best time complexity is O(n); When array in reverse order, 
the program needs to insert n (n-1) /2 times, then the time complexity is O (n^2). 
Therefore, for the function, the besr case time complexity is O(n), and the worst case time complexity is O(n^2);
