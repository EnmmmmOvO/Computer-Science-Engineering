Does an Euler path (NOT an Euler circuit) exist for this graph? Justify your answer.

This is the Euler path. The euler path can be determined by the number of lines that go to each point. 
Euler path with only two odd degree nodes or no odd degree nodes. In this case, 
there are two lines to 0, 2, 4, and 6 node, and four lines to the rest of the nodes. 
There is no odd degree node, so it is an Euler path.
