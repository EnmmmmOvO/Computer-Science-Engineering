The heapsort time is O(nlogn), and even if the worst case is O(nlogn), When the amount of data is large, it is more advantageous. Heap sorting has priority. In order of priority, the higher priority is first out of the queue. This is a good choice when following first-out, first-in rules . At the same time, for a dynamic sequence, it needs to maintain the sequence order, heap sort will be more convenient and faster than other sorts.
