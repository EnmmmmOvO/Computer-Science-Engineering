NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: 
The worst-case time complexity is when all the elements of the graph are arranged in a linear way,
looping through every cell in the maze and find the last element.

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: 
The worst-case time complexity is when all the elements of the graph are arranged in a linear way,
looping through every cell in the maze and find the last element.
