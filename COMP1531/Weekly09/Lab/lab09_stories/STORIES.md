As a university student, I want to set due dates of to-do items so that I can complete tasks on time. As its name implies, the to-do list shows the list of problems or things that need to be solved or done by the users. For myself, I do not use any to-do list application, I always write I usually write down my plans in the md file. But the trouble is that I must update the file every day. The contradiction thing is that the to-do list is showed what we cannot miss to do, but if I forget to open the file, the function of to-do list will loss. Similarly, some of the more popular software like Microsoft To Do, although they have a linkage between their own products, for other unsuitable software and problems encountered in life will rely on the user manual input. Popular software can solve my trouble, but we also rely on the Electronic equipment and internet, if the network is down, or Electronic equipment shuts down, the to-do list will not work. Therefore, if I face some problems, I think I need to solve as soon as possible. Use my mind to remember things that I cannot solve in the short term, although there is a risk that the brain will forget, it will always be smarter than the computer, and it will avoid reliance on electronic devices.
