## Lab09 - Exercise - Stories (2 points)

In this exercise we are posing a broad problem, and will ask you to write user stories associated with the problem. For simplicity, we won't get you to interview other people, but instead will have you act as though you're interviewing yourself (making the lab for easier to complete alone).

**The problem**: I can never find a to-do list application that I find is actually useful and satisfies the needs.

Write a series of user stories, from the perspective of YOUR particular goals required for a good to-do list application.

Add the stories to the file `STORIES.md`, just in dot point form. Write at least 5 of your own stories. An example is provided.
