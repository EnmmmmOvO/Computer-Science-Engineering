## Lab09 - Exercise - Fibonacci (1 point)

Recall the [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

```txt
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```

Complete a function `generate` in `fibonacci.py` that prints as many Fibonacci numbers as the user passes into the function.

Example: Calling `generate(10)` would produce `[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ]`

Write tests for your function in `fibonacci_test.py` to ensure 100% coverage. Ensure your code is pylint compliant.
