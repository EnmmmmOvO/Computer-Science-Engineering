# Lab03 - Exercise - Roman (2 points)

Complete the function `roman()` in `roman.py` according to its documentation.

Hints:

* Use a loop to iterate through the Roman numeral to figure out their value.
* Use a list of tuples to store the string characters and their respective values, compare the characters from the input to this list.
* Use a while loop so you can manually control the indices.

You can assume that all inputs are valid.

Write tests for the function in `roman_test.py`, a file you must create yourself.

*To receive full marks for this question you must achieve 100% coverage using `coverage`, as described in lectures.*
