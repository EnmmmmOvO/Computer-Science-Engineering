# Lab03 - Exercise - Timetable

In the lecture you were introduced to the `date` class and objects constructed from it. Python also comes with classes for `time`, a time independent of a particular day, and `datetime`, a combination of a date and a time.

Open `timetable.py` and complete the function `timetable()` according to its documentation.

Write some tests in a new file you create called `timetable_test.py`.

*To receive full marks for this question you must achieve 100% coverage using `coverage`, as described in lectures.*
*Please note: Coverage is not covered until the week 3 lectures, so you may not be able to complete part of this lab until then*
