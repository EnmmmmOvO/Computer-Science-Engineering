# Lab03 - Exercise - Prefix (1 point)

Open `prefix.py` and complete the function `prefix_search()` according to its documentation.

Some tests have been added in `prefix_test.py`. Ensure your solution passes those tests then write some of your own such that you have 100% code coverage of `prefix.py`.

To measure the coverage run `coverage run -m pytest` from the root of this repo. To view the coverage report use `coverage report`.

You can see your coverage percentage in the indicator at the top of this page. It will update after the pipeline completes. Note that the pipeline will only fail if tests fail, so you need to pay attention to both the pipeline success/failure and also the coverage percentage.

*Please note: Coverage is not covered until the week 3 lectures, so you may not be able to complete part of this lab until then*
