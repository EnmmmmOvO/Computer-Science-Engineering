# Lab03 - Challenge Exercise - Magic

Write a function `magic(square)` in a program `magic.py` that determines whether an array of n by n integers is a magic square.

Example input

```bash
$ python3 magic.py
3
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
Magic square
```

The return value is one of the following statements:
 * Magic square
 * Not a magic square
 * Invalid data: missing or repeated number

Some tests have been added in `magic_test.py`. Ensure your solution passes those tests. You are not required to write your own tests.
