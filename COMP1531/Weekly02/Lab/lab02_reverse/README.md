# Lab02 - Exercise - Reverse (1 point)

Open `reverse.py` and complete the function `reverse_words()` according to its documentation.

After completing this, write at least 5 tests using pytest, and include them in `test_reverse.py`. You should be able to run these tests by just running `pytest`.

The pipeline for this repo currently fails, as pytest cannot find any tests. Once you have written your tests, and implemented `reverse_words()` the pipeline should pass.
