# Lab02 - Exercise - Count (1 point)

Open `count.py` and read the documentation for stub function `count_char()`. To better understand what the function needs to do, write further tests in `test_count.py`. Each test should be its own function.

Once you're satisfied you have a good set of tests, implement the `count_char()` function.

Run your tests to ensure they pass.
