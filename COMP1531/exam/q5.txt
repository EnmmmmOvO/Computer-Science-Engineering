In your personal exam repository, answer this question in q5.txt .
Consider this requirement:
I really hate how slow the Gitlab pipelines can be when we're close to deadlines. I understand that lots of people arecramming just like me, and I understand that I could have planned my time better, but that won't stop me being annoyed, you know? The biggest issue I have is that when the pipelines are slow, even though I could run things locally, I don't have the confidence that my local code will work on CSE systems."
Q. Write a user story to capture the above requirement.

A. Ensure the smooth flow of GITLAB communications as the deadline approaches and ensure that the CSE system works smoothly and does not affect the work on the CSE.
