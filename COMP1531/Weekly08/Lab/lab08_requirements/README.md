## Lab08 - Exercise - Requirements (2 points)

*Refer to lecture slides (SDLC Requirements - Use Cases)*

Develop a use case for what you would consider a "heavy" user of the UNSW Dreams app you're building. Go through the processes of what they'd do, how the system would respond. You can use the course-hosted UNSW Dreams application (in the project specification) if you need something more visual.

You can represent your use case as either a list of dot points (including a text file in this repo), or a diagram (including an image in this repo).

If you'd like to use an image, you can use a tool such as (draw.io)[https://app.diagrams.net/].
