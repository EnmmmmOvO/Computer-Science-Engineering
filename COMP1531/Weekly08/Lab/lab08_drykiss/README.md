## Lab08 - Exercise - DRYKISS (1 point)

The code `drykiss.py` is unnecessarily complicated, and there is a lot of repetition. Take some time to refactor this code focusing on `DRY` and `KISS` to create a beautiful and concise piece of well understood code.

Improve the design of this code, and add a short comment or two explaining what you've done and why.

The code is currently pylint compliant as well as passing pytest. Ensure it remains that way.
