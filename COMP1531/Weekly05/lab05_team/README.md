## Lab05 - Exercise - Team (1 point)

By yourself, answer the following questions:

1. What do you expect will end up being the biggest challenges of working in a team by the end of the term?


In my opinion, my challenge is that although I finished the work, I have less communication with my teamwork because of my character. However, our team is a quite good team, we have a hard-working team leader and excellent teammates, and we have done our job well. I think the greatest challenge for our team our communication may be better corporation, as we did not know each other before, there was a relative lack, but I think we handled it well.


2. Now that we're half way through, what is one aspect of teamwork that you're hoping to learn more about?


For myself, how to better communicate with each other is that I am hoping to learn more about, better communication will reduce more reduce errors and avoid unnecessary trouble, I need to increase the time and times of chatting with my teammates
