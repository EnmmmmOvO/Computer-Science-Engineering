# COMP6771 Final Exam

Before beginning we are assuming that you have read and understood the [COMP6771 Exam Brief page on Webcms3](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP6771/22T2/resources/69860).

## Change Log

This section will be updated as clarifications and changes occur, and each addition will involve direct communication with students via email.

## Questions

 * [Question 1 specification](source/q1/README.md)
 * [Question 2 specification](source/q2/README.md)

## Marking Criteria

Your performance in your exam will be determined by the result of automated marking. We will compile your program, and run it against a series of tests that assess whether your program behaves as required. You will not know the full sample of tests used prior to marking.

Code that does not compile risks receiving no automarks for that question.

If you submit your work and your tentative grade is nearing a fail of any hurdle, and it's due to trivial and easily-resolvable errors (the definition of easily-resolvable is at our discretion), we may modify your code and run it again.

## Submission

Our systems automatically record the most recent push you make to your master branch. Therefore, to "submit" your code you simply need to make sure that your master branch (on the gitlab website) is the code that you want marked for this task.

It is your responsibiltiy to ensure that your code can be successfully demonstrated on the CSE machines (e.g. vlab) from a fresh clone of your repository. Failure to ensure this may result in a loss of marks.

Please note: Remember to ensure your code works on the UNSW CSE machines. If you develop on Vlab this is probably fine, but if you've developed locally ensure it runs on vlab OK. Failure to do so could result in a fail mark in the exam.

## Sanity checking

If you want to check if you've actually submitted your questions, and see if they pass a very basic compilation example, then run this command on the CSE systems.

## Originality of Work

The work you submit must be your own work. Submission of work partially or completely derived from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted.

The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks, automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline. Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually for such submissions.

Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.

Do not provide or show your assignment work to any other person — apart from the teaching staff of COMP6771.

If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any reason, and work derived from it is submitted, you may be penalized, even if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent.  This may apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.

Note you will not be penalized if your work has the potential to be taken without your consent or knowledge.
