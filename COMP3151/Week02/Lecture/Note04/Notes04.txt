Built-in operators

- Normal propositional logic operators

  ¬, ∧, ...

- Temporal operators

 ◯φ   "in the next state, φ holds"
 φ 𝒰 ψ "φ holds for (at least) finitely
        many states; then, ψ holds"
 ◇φ "eventually, φ will hold"
 □φ "φ always holds"

ρ|3 "the timeline ρ without the first 3 states"

◇□(♥ ∧ ♠) "eventually, ♥ ∧ ♠ is always true"



ρ

   ♥    -   ♠   ♠    ♠ 
---|----|---|---|----|---   ....

The above timeline does *not* satisfy
  ρ ⊧ □(♥ 𝒰 ♠)

If we replace heart #1 with nothing,
is it satisfied?
 A: no


  ♥ 𝒰 ♠
  For some n:
  - ♥ must be true in the next n states
  - in the n:th state, ♠ must be true


ρ

   ♥    -   ♠   ♥    ♥
---|----|---|---|----|---   ....

The above timeline does *not* satisfy
  ρ ⊧ □(♥ 𝒰 ♠)
