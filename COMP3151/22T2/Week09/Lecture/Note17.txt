In the slides' presentation of Chandy-Lamport algorithm:

  we assume that messages are just sequence numbers.


   Aaron ---> Becky ---> Cathy --> Aaron


  Aaron ⇒ Becky : 1
  Becky ⇒ Cathy : 2
  Cathy ⇒ Aaron : 3
  **Aaron wants to take a snapshot**  <-- here
  **Aaron sends marker to Becky**
  Aaron ⇐ Cathy : 3          
  Becky ⇐ Aaron : 1
  Cathy ⇐ Becky : 2
  **Becky receives marker from Aaron**
  **Becky sends a marker to Cathy
    - records local state**
  **Cathy receives marker from Becky**
  **Cathy sends a marker to Aaron
    - records local state**      
  **Aaron receives marker from Cathy**
  **Aaron record local state**

State of system when snapshot is  taken:
  All messages are sent, and still afloat.

State of system in snapshot:
  Aaron's local state:
     sent: Aaron ⇒ Becky : 1
     received: nothing
     on channel:  Aaron ⇐ Cathy : 3

  Becky's local state:
     sent:     Becky ⇒ Cathy : 2                     
     received: Becky ⇐ Aaron : 1

  ^^ this never happened

Q: What's the relationship between what was the case when we initiated,
    and the snapshot as actually recorded?
A: The snapshot can be reconstructed from the global history,
   by reordering causally independent events.

We can partition the history into:
  pre-recording events  happens at node i, before node i sees a marker
  post-recording events happens at node i, after node i sees a marker or initiates

  Aaron ⇒ Becky : 1                      pre
  Becky ⇒ Cathy : 2                      pre
  Cathy ⇒ Aaron : 3                      pre
  **Aaron wants to take a snapshot**
  Aaron ⇐ Cathy : 3                      post
  Becky ⇐ Aaron : 1                      pre
  Cathy ⇐ Becky : 2                      pre
  **Becky receives marker from Aaron**
  **Cathy receives marker from Becky**
  **Aaron record local state**          

Observation (from the Chandy-Lamport paper):
  pre-recording events can't depend on post-recording events
Therefore: another ordering that is consistent with the causal order,
    is to put all pre-events before all post-events.

  Aaron ⇒ Becky : 1                      pre
  Becky ⇒ Cathy : 2                      pre
  Cathy ⇒ Aaron : 3                      pre
  **Aaron wants to take a snapshot**
  Becky ⇐ Aaron : 1                      pre
  Cathy ⇐ Becky : 2                      pre
  *** the snapshot is this state ***
  Aaron ⇐ Cathy : 3                      post
  **Becky receives marker from Aaron**
  **Cathy receives marker from Becky**
  **Aaron record local state**
