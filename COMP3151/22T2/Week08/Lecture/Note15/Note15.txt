Distributed mutual exclusion taxonomy:
- Permission-based (Ricart-Agrawala)
  - I can enter the CS once I have received
    explicit permission to do so from everybody
- Token-based (also Ricart-Agrawala)
  - There's a single token floating around;
  - Whoever holds the token gets to be in the CS.
- Quorum-based
  - A variant of permission-based solutions.
  - Receive permission from a *quorum* of nodes,
    instead of every node.
    Quorum = a subset of the nodes, such that
             all quorums overlap in some way.

In Algorithm 2.1: explicit "while true" around the
                  pseudocode


Algorithm 2.3: note that sendToken is
  not a stand-alone process, it is a subroutine.
