Jasmin Revision History                                     Jonathan Meyer

11 Apr 97 - Release 1.06.

11 Apr 97

   * Fixed bug which prevented the source name from being written out
     in the class file

   * Improved README file

2 Mar 97 - Release 1.05.

1 Mar 97

   * Moved scripts into a bin directory. 

   * Added support for Visual J++.

     Added vjasmin.bat, for running Jasmin using Visual J++.

     Converted JAS/Jasmin to use its own internal RuntimeConstants, so that
     there is no longer any dependency on Sun's version (needed by J++).

   * Tidied API:

     Renamed "Jasmin" class "ClassFile" (sorry to those of you using the API
     from 1.04). The ClassFile class is documented in the doc/api directory.

   * Mods for Java 1.1:

     Classes now set the ACC_SUPER bit in their access flags.
     i2b/i2s/i2c are now synonyms for int2byte, int2short, int2char.
     invokespecial is now a synonym for invokenonvirtual.

   * Mods to pick up documentation in book:
    
     "wide" is now a recognized instruction in Jasmin files - although the assembler
     just ignores it!
 
     Added the optional <high> parameter to tableswitch. 

   * Fixed bug in .catch all
    
10 Feb 96 - Release 1.04.

8 Feb 97
   * Updated to use latest version of JAS. This fixes some bugs in the
     earlier release (including handling of _w instructions)

   * Split several of the internal classes into smaller pieces.

   * Restructured internal sources so that Jasmin, Scanner and parser
     no longer rely on static data structures. Now there is a public API
     to Jasmin, for people that want to assemble classes using their own
     data input/output streams.

30 Oct 96

   * Added support for more \ escapes in quoted strings. In
     particular, you can now use \nnn to specify a character using
     octal.

2 Oct 96 - Release 1.03.

1 Oct 96

   * Added better support for interfaces: added the .interface
     directive (an alternative to the .class directive), and also a
     .implements directive. Updates guide.html to mention these new
     features.

24 Sept 96

   * Fixed several problems with guide.html - thanks to feedback from
     Shawn Silverman (umsilve1@cc.umanitoba.ca).

23 Aug 96

   * Tidied up documentation and implementation for wide instructions.

     Now ldc and ldc_w are used for single-word items, whereas
     ldc2_w is used for two word items (previously, I had ldc_w as
     a synonym for ldc2_w - oops).

25 July 96

   * Added documentation for .var directive.

   * Fixed line numbering produced by -g flag (I hope).

   * Improved error reporting slightly.

24 July 96

   * Added fix to scanner to handle Ctrl-M characters,
     for DOS/NT Systems. (Thanks sbk!)

18 July 96 - Release 1.0.
