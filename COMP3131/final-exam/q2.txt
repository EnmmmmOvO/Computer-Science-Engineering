Question 2

(a) Write a leftmost derivation for the sentence 5 + 4 âˆ— 3 / 2.
    1. expr
    2. ==> term + expr
    3. ==> factor + expr
    4. ==> 5 + expr
    5. ==> 5 + term
    6. ==> 5 + factor * term
    7. ==> 5 + 4 * term
    8. ==> 5 + 4 * term / factor
    9. ==> 5 + 4 * factor / factor
    10. ==> 5 + 4 * 3 / factor
    11. ==> 5 + 4 * 3 / 2


(b) Draw a parse tree for this sentence.
    See page 1 of q2.pdf file


(c) If the operators +, * and / represent the operations of integer addition, integer multiplication and integer (truncated) division, respectively, what would be the value implied by your parse tree found in (b)?
    1. 3/2 = 1
    2. 4 * (3/2) = 4 * 1 = 4
    3. 5 + 4 * (3/2) = 5 + 4 = 9
    Answer: 9

(d) Is this grammar ambiguous? Justify your answer.
    It's ambiguous.
    Consider the string "1*3/2". Following are 2 different valid parse trees for the string from the CFG:

(e) Answer the following true or false questions about this grammar:
    1. True
    2. False
    3. False
    4. False
    5. True
    6. True
