## Use CSS to generate a complex layout of images

Build a page that looks identical to `exercise3/page.jpg`. The window width you should work with is 1896 x 1073 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

![](page.jpg)

Please build your page in `exercise3/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `exercise3` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

### Assets

* Assets can be found in `assets` which you can use for your solution.
* Your font doesn't have to match exactly. You may use font-family `Georgia` or `serif` for the page.
* You may use a Lorem Ipsum generator such as [this](https://www.lipsum.com/) to generate the text.

### Analysing the pages

Two things will want to seek external help for are (that you can't determine just by "looking" at it):
1) Determining the particular colour (RGB or HEX) of various pixels (we recommend the use of [the Firefox eye dropper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Eyedropper), though other alternatives may be appropriate for you)
2) Determining the size of particular elements (we recommend the use of [photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)). An example of it's usage is below:

### How closely to match images

Your page has to generally look the same, but doesn't have to be pixel perfect. We won't use a magnifying glass, though we will expect you to get the big things right. If you feel uncertain, please post in the forum.
