## Fully generate HTML with Vanilla JS DOM manipulation (including a loop)

A stub page has been created in `page.html`. This page has an empty body tag, and we want you to build the page below, however, only using javascript and the DOM API. The DOM lectures will give you a starting point for this work.

Fill the script `build.js` file to build the following HTML elements within the body tag.

```html
<div>
    <p>Hello there,</p>
    <p>I am a llama, hear my sirens roar:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The</li>
        <li>Duck</li>
        <li>Lemonade</li>
        <li>Stand</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

**Note: You are not allowed to set the inner HTML of elements directly. You must use methods like `createElement` and `appendChild` from week 2 DOM lectures**
