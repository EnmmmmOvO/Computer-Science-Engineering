> Things to look out for include:
> * An over-reliance on inline styles
> * CSS definitions not reusing common definitions
> * CSS definitions not having very meaningful names
> * Overly complex HTML or CSS layouts
> * Lack of indentation or correct style for HTML/CSS

> Some obvious things with the Buckland page are:
>  * Capitalised HTML tags
>  * Lots of HTML tags aren't closed
>  * Use of `<blockquote>` and other tags to describe style, instead of CSS
>  * Use of HTML attributes (e.g. `bgcolor`) instead of CSS
>  * CSS file is named `.html`
>  * CSS file is inconsistently formatted
