<!--        <p style="text-indent: 30pt"><i><del>You are welcome to email me. I enjoy getting email.</del></i></p>-->
        <blockquote><i><del>You are welcome to email me. I enjoy getting email.</del></i></blockquote>

        <p>
            ... but i no longer enjoy getting email as I get too much and I feel very guilty about not being able to
            read it all.

            So rather than emailing me please just come by at then end of a lecture and chat to me then.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you feel you <b>must</b> email me then, to increase the chance of it being read,
            please read the following notes first:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>I get too much email to read it all.</li>
            <li>I cope with my mail load by deleting much of my mail without reading it.</li>
            <li>
                I do this because I have lots of work to do,
                lots of students to teach and help (typically over 700 at any one time),
                and a wonderful family to spend as much time with as I can.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mail items automatically get deleted by my mail program unless they match certain criteria.
                To get through the filters you need to use the right address and subject line,
                as set out in the table below
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>STEP 1: Use the correct subject line</h4>

        <p>
            The subject line should describe what the mail is about.
            Please spend 20 seconds or so and select a thoughful subject line for your email message to me.
            This is a wonderful habit to get into generally for all your email.
        </p>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30pt">comp1A Ass #3 - when will the spec be released?</p>

        <p>Thanks!</p>

        <h4>STEP 2: Use the correct address</h4>

        <div style="text-align: center" >
            [an error occurred while processing this directive]<br />

            replace fred nurk with @ in these addresses<br />

            <table border="1" class="table_block">
                <tr>
                    <td><b>If you are ...</b></td>
                    <td><b>then mail me at the address ...</b></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

    <h4>STEP 3: If it doesn't work</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Even if you get thru my email filters there is a good chance I won't see your email.
            I only spend an hour a day at most on email,
            and in that time I often don't even get to see all the mail which has come in that day.
            I work from the most recent email backwards and each day the list of unread email grows slightly.
        </li>

        <li>
            So if I don't respond in a few days I'm not ignoring you, I just didn't get to read your email.
            Resend it politely every few days until you get a response.
        </li>
    </ul>
