## Use CSS to replicate a website hero image section

Build a page that looks identical to `page.jpg`. The window width you should work with is 1896 x 870 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in `index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `exercise6` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.
