Look at `eris.html`. It has a large div with a grey background. Try to:

* Toggle with the `no-repeat` property.
* Toggle the width and height of the background with respect to the outer element
* Toggle with the `position` property

Notes:
 * If you're familiar with the `background` short-cut property, try and complete this question both with and without it
