## Use CSS to replicate a layout of information about cities

Build a page that looks identical to `page.jpg`. The window width you can work with is up to you. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

![](./page.jpg)

Please build your page in `index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need.

### Assets

* Please use the following images:
    * Sydney: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Oceania/Australia/Sydney/sydney-guide-lead-sunset.jpg
    * Melboune: https://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/au/en/news/news_Melbourne_AdobeStock.jpg
    * Adelaide: https://d31atr86jnqrq2.cloudfront.net/images/aerial-city-adelaide.jpg
* Your font doesn't have to match exactly. You may use font-family `Arial` or `sans-serif` for the page.

### Analysing the pages

Two things will want to seek external help for are (that you can't determine just by "looking" at it):
1) Determining the particular colour (RGB or HEX) of various pixels (we recommend the use of [the Firefox eye dropper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Eyedropper), though other alternatives may be appropriate for you)
2) Determining the size of particular elements (we recommend the use of [photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)). An example of it's usage is explained in the assignment 1 spec.

### How closely to match images

Your page has to generally look the same, but doesn't have to be pixel perfect. We won't use a magnifying glass, though we will expect you to get the big things right. If you feel uncertain, please post in the forum.
