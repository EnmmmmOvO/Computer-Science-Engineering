## Using dev tools to directly modify a page's content

Using only the dew tools in your browser, complete the following:

- Duplicate the button with the class `original-button`
- Change the class on the new button to `devtools-button`
- Change the button content to `devtools button`
- Modify the styles for the `devtools-button` class so that the button looks similar to:
  ![purple button](./button.png)
- Add a style directly on the button element `z-index` of `1`.
- Modify the styles so that when hovered, it shrinks to `0.75` size over 500ms.
- Adjust the properties of the class such that the button is 25% smaller on screen widths less than `600px`, and completely disappears on screen widths less than `400px`.

When you're done, copy the styles to the `index.html` file and create a button with class `devtools-button`.
