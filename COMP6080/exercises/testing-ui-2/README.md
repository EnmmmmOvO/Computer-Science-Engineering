## Write tests for a full UI (2)

Write UI tests using `Cypress` for a 10 seconds countdown timer and see `Launch!` when it ends. You can install it by running `yarn add -D cypress` which will add `cypress` to dev dependencies.

You can then run cypress with `yarn run cypress open` to open the test runner. The first time you run the command, it will configure cypress in your project and create a `cypress/` folder at the root level of your project. In there you can see some examples in the `integration/` folder and that's were you can add your own tests!

Play around with the [timer app](exercise/src/App.js) and think about how you should test it.
