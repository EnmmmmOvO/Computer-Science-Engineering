### Alt text

What is alt text?

> Alt text, short for ‘alternative text’ is an HTML attribute that provides a short description of image.

Why is alt text useful?

> * For users who are unable to see images (using a screen reader, have low vision, etc.)
> * Fallback description if the image fails to display (e.g. there is a problem with the src attribute)
> *	Helping with SEO – keywords from the alt text help tag/categorise the image/page

When do we need alt text?
> For all images which aren't decorative.

Identify which images on this page (https://nucleus.unsw.edu.au/en/contact-us) are decorative and don’t require alt text

> Discuss the UNSW logo, yellow banner, and icons.

### Contrast

What is contrast and why does it matter?

> Contrast refers to the difference between colours on a webpage, especially the colour of text and their surroundings. The difference must be stark enough that they can be differentiated.

> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines specify in more detail what level of contrast is required by a contrast ratio. This differs for small text vs big text, and takes into account text in images and also text with borders or halos.

A number of colour combinations are present in `contrast.html`. Have a look at them and discuss which are suitable, and what can be done to improve each.

> Use the tools in the console to emulate vision deficiencies and show how some combinations are visible to us without deficiencies, but can be difficult for those who are colourblind. (More tools -> Rendering -> Emulate vision deficiencies)

Modify the colours in `contrast.html` to improve their contrast.
