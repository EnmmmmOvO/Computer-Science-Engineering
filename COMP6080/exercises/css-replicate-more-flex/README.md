Challenge: Create 5 boxes within the main section of the page that:
 * Have a minimum width of `200px`
 * Have a maximum width of `300px`
 * Occupy as much of the space as possible otherwise
 * Overflow onto the next line if there are too many in a row (i.e. flex)
 * Have a gap of 5px around the elements
