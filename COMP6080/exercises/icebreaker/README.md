Your tutor will introduce themselves and a little bit of their background.

Your tutor will share with you a shared document (e.g. hackmd or google doc). They will then break you into groups of 3.

In these groups of 3, you will spend 5 minutes collecting 4 links to websites each.

2 of these links should be websites that your group thinks is great and a short phrase/sentence as to why for each.

The other 2 links shuold be websites that your group thinks is pretty awful and a short phrase/sentence as to why for each.

You will come back and discuss together!
