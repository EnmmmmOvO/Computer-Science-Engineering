## Convert a modern promise to an old school AJAX request

In a new file `store_oldschool.html`, replace any usage of promise syntax (`Promise`, `.then()`, `.catch()`) with more basic callbacks and XML requests (AJAX). The week lecture slides on XHR will be helpful to understand this.

The aim of this exercise is to gain an understanding of some of the fundamental mechanisms that are still used on a lot of transpiled code.
