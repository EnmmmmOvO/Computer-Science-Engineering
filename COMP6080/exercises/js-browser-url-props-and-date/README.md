## Interacting with window objects and the date function

We have created a webpage `me.html` that is just an empty HTML page where some javascript runs.

Using basic javascript knowledge, implement this page to console log "My name is X and my age is Y" when the page is loaded with the following added to the URL:

`me.html?name=francis&age=72`

You can access the URL of a webpage via the stub code we have provided. It returns the URL as a basic string.
