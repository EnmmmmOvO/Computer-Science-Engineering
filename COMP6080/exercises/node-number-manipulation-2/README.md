## Using NodeJS to solve simple problems (2)

A javascript file that can be run with `node` has been created in `exercise5/data.js`. You must complete this program to analyse the numbers and print out the following result using the `console.log` function to print:

A list of numbers has been provided at the top of the file, and your output needs to print:
 * A list of all negative numbers, in ascending order, surrounded by `[` and `]`, e.g. `[ -4, -2, -1 ]`
 * A single number that is the average of all positive numbers disivisble (without remainder) by 6, .e.g. `8.4`
 * A list of all numbers great than 600, as they appear in the list, but printed in reverse order, e.g. `[ 620, 610, 800 ]`

When running `node exercise5/data.js` from the project folder, the expected output is (replacing X, Y, Z, etc with correct values):
```txt
List of negatives = [ X, Y, Z ]
Average of positive numbers 6 divisible = X
List of large numbers in reverse = [ X, Y, Z ]
