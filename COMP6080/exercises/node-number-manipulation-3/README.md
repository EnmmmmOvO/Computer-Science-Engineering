## Using NodeJS to solve simple problems (3)

Simple NodeJS script

A javascript file that can be run with `node` has been created in `range.js`. The program must be completed by you. The program must read in a text file (one of `data1.txt`, `data2.txt`, or `data3.txt`) which contains integers on some of the lines. The program will determine the lowest and highest valued number, and print out the "range" (i.e. difference between max and min) as per the output below:
```txt
The range is 421.
```

Ensure your code works for all 3 data files. You must not import any libraries. Try and write it as standard C/python style as you can, don't try and overcomplicate things on the first run.

You can assume the first two lines of code don't need to be fully understood, but if you're familiar with python they should generally make sense.
