## Use CSS to create a mobile-first page, then use a framework too

### Part 1

Provided in this question is a `responsive.html` and a `responsive.css` file. There are nine images in the `responsive.html` file. In this exercise, you will be laying out the images in three rows first using hardcoded CSS, then responsive CSS, and then finally using a framework to do so.

In the HTML file, arrange the images in a row of 4, then a row of 3, and finally a row of 2.

Assign each image in each row with a set pixel width so that each row of images stretches across the entire screen uniformly. Use your DevTools to adjust the screen dimensions. What happens with the images in the image rows? Is this considered responsive design? Why or why not?

What can we do to make this more responsive? Apply your solutions to the HTML and CSS file. 

Why is the current design considered responsive?

Finally, let's use CSS frameworks to help making our webpage responsive, easier. We will be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). What are CSS frameworks, and why would they be useful to us?

Apply the grid system provided by Boostrap to `responsive.html`.

### Part 2

`pricing-plans.html` contains four columns that compare the subscription plans for an online service. `pricing-plans.css` contains the CSS that for the corresponding HTML file. How can we make this page more responsive?

Once those changes are made, would you consider the page responsive? In what ways is `pricing-plans.html` is it? Under what circumstances and in what ways is it not responsive? What could be done to make it more responsive? Apply the changes.

What Bootstrap features can we apply to the page?
