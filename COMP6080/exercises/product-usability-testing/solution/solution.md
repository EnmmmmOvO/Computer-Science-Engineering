## Explore some usability testing to validate an app

Usability tests are a way to understand how users would navigate and use a website. They are usually led by a facilitator, who will present the user with a number of tasks which are selected to mimic common user flows through an application. If the usability test is aiming to raise issues about specific parts of the application, the tasks can be more specific. The user will then try to accomplish the task, whilst speaking aloud their thoughts and in particular any parts they found confusing. This information can then be used to improve the existing design of a page. They can be done both synchronously, or asynchronously with the user recording their progress and thoughts.

### Part A

Let’s run through a quick example of a usability test using the Jetstar website (https://www.jetstar.com/au/).

> The tutor could be the facilitator and could ask a student to volunteer to be the user, but if no one is willing, then you could play both roles yourself.

This is a summary of the process:
* The user will share their screen
* The facilitator will give the user a task or goal to complete
* The user will try to achieve said goal
* The facilitator asks the user further questions to target any potential issues raised during the test.

> The task: From the homepage, you would like to browse return flights from Sydney to any destination over the next couple months.

> If a student is helping, encourage them to use the ‘think-aloud’ principle and explain all their thoughts. 

After the user has completed the task, whether successfully or unsuccessfully, the facilitator can ask further questions to get the user to elaborate on their thoughts.

> e.g. if their initial instinct was to look at the menu bar, why is that? Why do they think certain sections of the menu would have the information they’re looking for? 

Now, we want to record our findings, in particular the problems. Make a dot point list of all the sections that were confusing, revisiting the user flow through the site.

>If the user suggested any improvements, record that too, although for this process right now we don’t need to actually solve any issues, just identify them.

### Part B

Let’s come up with some possible prompts if we wanted to specifically target a certain section of a website. 

Keep in mind they can’t be too specific as to ‘give away’ how to use the site (e.g. rather than “you want to find the contact details in the menu bar”, try “you want to contact someone for help about rescheduling a flight”.

> This is pretty open-ended and open for students to provide suggestions. A good website to use for this could be the handbook https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/
