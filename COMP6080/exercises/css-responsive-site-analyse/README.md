## Analysis of websites and how they deal with responsiveness

Your tutor will break you into groups of 3.

In each group, find a website that you think have very separate mobile and laptop/desktop layouts. For this webpage:
 * Write down it's URL
 * Identify the breakpoint of the page (the width that it tends to switch from mobile to larger)
 * Write down any key changes that occur (e.g. items collapsed into menu, limited functionality in mobile).

After you come back together, your tutor will go through a couple of groups work and discuss it with the class as a whole.
