## Take a specification and scope out and plan an app (before coding)

For the sake of this exercise, we will try and code up a simplified [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) clone.

Before even opening your text editor, there are three things that you should ideally do. They are:

1. Considering your User Experience (UX)
2. Creating Mockups - Bridging User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
3. Considering your User Interface (UI)

### **User Experience**

When considering UX, the primary question is how do we help users achieve their goals? This requires us to clarify who our users are, and what their goals are.

If you are planning to build a Kahoot clone, who will be the users of your quiz software?

Can we place these users into general archetypes? If so, what would these be?

What would be the general goals for these users and archetypes?

Once we have the general users and their goals outlined, we can be more specific with how we can get the user archetypes to acheive their goals, using the user goals in mind. We do this through creating user stories. Create 3 user stories for your Kahoot clone.

### **Mockups**

Mockups are used to plan out your app, and they are used as a graphical representation of how you would lay out your app. These can range from a single screen, to a whole flow which would show how a user would navigate through your app when certain elements are interacted with.

Create a mockup of the screen a player sees when they are answering a question.

### **User Interaction**

The last thing you need to think about before coding your app is how your user will interact with your application. Part of this is thinking about the colour palette for your application, and the components you will use. This is really up to you.

There are a lot of colour palette guides that you can find online, but here's a good [primer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/comprehensive-guide-for-color-usage-in-web-design-e2a9afce09fb/)!
