## Take a specification and scope out and plan an app (before coding)

You are a student taking COMP6080 Web Front-End Programming, and at some point, you want to code up a [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) clone.

Before even opening your text editor, there are three things that you should ideally do. They are:

1. Considering your User Experience (UX)
2. Creating Mockups - Bridging User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
3. Considering your User Interface (UI)

### **User Experience**

When considering UX, the primary question is how do we help users achieve their goals? This requires us to clarify who our users are, and what their goals are.

If you are planning to build a Kahoot clone, who will be the users of your quiz software?

> Users would include:
> - Teachers
> - Students
> - Presenters
> - Team-building people
> 
> As well as any others that you want to include.

Can we place these users into general archetypes? If so, what would these be?

> Yes, the archetypes could be
> - Creators
> - Hosts
> - Players

What would be the general goals for these users and archetypes?

> For example:
>
> Users:
> - Teacher's goal would be to reinforce taught concepts in a fun way
> - Student's goal would be to test their knowledge in a competitive and interactive way
> - Presenter's goal would be to better engage their audience
> - Team-building people's goal would be to facilitate team bonding in a competitive environment
>
> Archetypes: 
> - Creator's goal would be to create a quiz 
> - Host's goal would be to host a multiplayer quiz
> - Player's goal would be to play the quizzes

Once we have the general users and their goals outlined, we can be more specific with how we can get the user archetypes to acheive their goals, using the user goals in mind. We do this through creating user stories. Create 3 user stories for your Kahoot clone.

> The format of a user story is: **As a \<persona\>, I want to \<task\>, so that I can \<goal\>.**
>
> For example:
> - As a player, I want to be able to play a quiz without logging in, so that I can quickly take part in a quiz
> - As a creator, I want to be able to upload images and video to my quizzes, so that I can create a more engaging presentation
> - As a host, I want to be able to kick players from a lobby, so that I can moderate players who have joined my game lobby

### **Mockups**

Mockups are used to plan out your app, and they are used as a graphical representation of how you would lay out your app. These can range from a single screen, to a whole flow which would show how a user would navigate through your app when certain elements are interacted with.

Create a mockup of the screen a player sees when they are answering a question.

> You can use:
> - [Balsamiq Wireframes on Google Drive](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/google-drive/) - it's paid but there is a free trial, and that is sufficient.
> - [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - free but a bit more difficult to use
>
> Create a low fidelity (Rough outline) mockup of the screen a player sees when a question appears. Use the equivalent Kahoot screen as reference. Elements would include:
> - Question text
> - Question order (e.g. 2 out of 5)
> - Answers
> - Timer

### **User Interaction**

The last thing you need to think about before coding your app is how your user will interact with your application. Part of this is thinking about the colour palette for your application, and the components you will use. This is really up to you.

There are a lot of colour palette guides that you can find online, but here's a good [primer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/comprehensive-guide-for-color-usage-in-web-design-e2a9afce09fb/)!
