## The basic editing of a ReactJS CRA (very basic)

Go into your react folder by running `cd react`

Create a react app using `npx create-react-app react`. This will create a new react app in that folder for you. This may take a while :)

`cd` into that folder then type `ls` and you should see some files including `package.json`. If you don't see these files you are in the wrong directory and have made a mistake.

Open the file `src/App.js` in an editor. This is the file we are going to edit for this lab.

In your terminal window run `yarn start` which will start up the development environment (essentailly a mini deployment that will automatically reload when you make changes to your code).

Modify the `App.js` file to change the text `Edit src/App.js and save to reload` with the text `Pa-ran-nah!`. 

Once you've done this, replace the current image (`<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />`) with *any* other image you want (it's up to you! We just want to see that you've changed it).

Now you've completed the activity.
