Available September 15
A long time ago we didn't used to eat much fruit, but people kept getting sick and realising you can't just eat meat and beans all the time. So viola, fruit became popular. We're here to sell fruit, and I'm running out of things to say to sell you the fruit.

Just buy the fruit please I need the money.
