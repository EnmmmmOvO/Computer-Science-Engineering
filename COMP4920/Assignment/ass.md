>  For corporate projects such as design painting, illustration and even video creation, drawing AI will be revolutionary. Compared with ordinary painters or creators who need plenty of time to conceive and create a painting, painting artificial intelligence based on neural networks can finish the creation at such short notice, which will greatly reduce the time required for projects of large enterprises. At the same time, because the object of creation has become a machine without emotion, the demander can ask the machine to change the content created infinitely, it also reduces the possibility of conflict between demander and creator because of the disagreement caused by many revisions. In addition, compared with the expensive labor cost, low payment has also become a significant advantage of painting artificial intelligence. More small and medium-sized enterprises have the opportunity to create products comparable to large enterprises through this technology. 
>
> For ordinary humans, individual consumption ability is the biggest limitation to pursue art. Ordinary humans will be more willing to choose drawing AI as it has low pay, even free to use. In addition, drawing AI provides no very good painting ability of ordinary human also can obtain belongs to own work of art has to satisfy ordinary human spiritual pursuit of beauty and art, help more human have the opportunity to close with art, create their own art and unique features in their own design needs, such as house decoration and personal social software design.
>
> This was a blow to professions such as painters and illustrators, just as the advent of the machine deprived some manual workers of their jobs. It has revolutionized art creation, which was thought to be conceived only by the human brain and could not be replaced by machines. As discussed above, compared with drawing AI, the time required, and the high cost of payment will be the most important factors affecting the work of some painting practitioners.

**Consider your users and the stakeholders. List them all and describe their attributes and traits, needs and skills, why they are considered a user or a stakeholder. [600 words]**

> Artist (painters, illustrators, etc.)  [both user & stakeholder]
>
> > The artist is the group most directly affected by drawing AIs. Artists mainly include painters, Computer Graphics industry practitioners and others who need to use sketching boards and software like photoshop or Illustrator to draw. Due to the maturity of drawing AIs technology, many works that require artists to draw for a long time can be completed by machine. The latter takes a short time to provide many solutions that meet the requirements and cost less than the remuneration required by artists. In this respect, painters who create for enterprise projects, and personal needs, will be the main stakeholders affected.
> > On the other hand, artists who paint for interests or personal hobbies can also be a user. The maturity of drawing AIs technology will promote the creation of painters. Painters only need to input their ideas, obtain results through drawing AIs, and then perform secondary creation to create products in line with expectations. It also provides more inspiration for painters.
>
> Art exhibition host [stakeholder]
>
> > Art exhibition hosts mainly include those who create, plan or assist in art and cultural exhibitions or activities. They will collect or temporarily borrow works of art created by contemporary or former artists and display them to the public. With the emergence of drawing AIs, the channels for the public to pursue art are no longer limited to exhibitions or other ways to view works of art with their own eyes. Drawing AIs provides channels for ordinary people to create their works of art and improves their ability to appreciate art. As a result, the art of half or below-average quality may no longer be acceptable to the public. Therefore, Art exhibition hosts are stakeholders, as the maturity and popularization of drawing AIs will indirectly impact an art exhibition.

**Using value-sensitive design, conduct a conceptual investigation around the human values in the technology. Pick three main users/ stakeholders (one per every group member) out of your list of possible users/stakeholders and perform an imaginary role play to discuss the possible impact of the technology to them. You can use the Judgment Call game3 (printable) as a tool to review these technologies from the point of view of the stakeholders. Discuss the impact of the technology along each of the ethical principles (e.g. Microsoft’s ethical principles of fairness, privacy and security, reliability and safety, transparency, inclusion, and accountability), as shown in the Judgment Call’s cards. Ideally, perform this task before you conduct the research in the next step. Record your discussions (e.g. take photos) and summarise the conceptual investigation. [2000 words]**

*Scenario*: <u>A person submitted an artwork generated by a drawing AI to an art contest</u>

*Key word*: <u>Philosopher 3 Inclusion</u>

> From an ethical point of view, if the tournament explicitly requires that the use of AI be prohibited, this participant is unethical because he breaks the rules. More in line with the scenario under discussion is that there is no explicit requirement. Hence, the key to determining whether a tournament is ethical is whether it is fair to all participants. 
>
> Drawing comparisons are mainly about comparing the ideas of the painters as well as their abilities. If the competition prefers unique ideas, drawing AI is fair because it is only a tool for participants with no drawing experience to show them fundamental ideas. Especially for some groups who are unable to paint due to disabilities or lesions, it provides the opportunity to output the closest picture to their idea through many attempts by AI. Drawing AI gives everyone the right and chance to participate in the competition. In addition, AI creation is a machine combined with the critical features of the input things and the learning of hundreds of millions of previous or contemporary painters' paintings to create paintings in line with the experience of the general aesthetic. Essentially AI is guessing the user's ideas based on the input keywords, which is more similar to a person dictating ideas for the painter and requesting the artist to draw. Compared with an artist drawing following his thought, the latter can be more non-destructive in showing their ideas. From this perspective, the use of AI is fair. 
>
> Suppose the competition prefers individual drawing ability. AI has lowered the bar for art competitions and allows people who have not put any effort into the drawing period to create artwork in a short time comparable to or even better than those created by contemporary painters with their efforts. It is a negation of their efforts and is highly unfair.  
>
> Therefore, the key to judging the contest is fairness needs to be judged by the nature of the contest and the participants. Suppose this competition is a contest of ability or an examination of students' ability in an art school. In that case, using AI is unacceptable and even a kind of cheating, cheating behaviour. If it is just a competition of ideas, then AI is an excellent tool to allow more people to experience and enjoy the competition. Moreover, the better solution is for the competition organizer to specify the uncertainties, whether the competition allows using AI and the scope and purpose of the use. To ensure that all competitors The decision will be made by all participants. 
>
> In addition, how to define the attribution of an artwork created by drawing AI and the user when a user uses AI and makes some modifications. Just as submitting a paper to use others' materials as reference and borrowing are permissible. Suppose a user draws on the results provided by AI as a basis or inspiration and makes some extensive modifications. In that case, it is unfair to define the attribution of artwork as AI directly. The essence of drawing AI is to serve people, so it should allow modification and borrowing within a specific range. Therefore, it is necessary to set a modification magnitude to define the attribution problem of creating by AI or user.

> Thanks for Peter. Now let me introduce about out team’s judgement call. Just like the controversy of Jason Allen uses AI artwork winning the first place at an art competition, our judgement call’s scenario is that A person submitted an artwork generated by a drawing AI to an art competition. As shows above, there are six stakeholders. Our team members randomly select three of them and identify principle and rating by the way of roll wheel.
>
> For Peter's part, he discussed from the perspective of the public. Public may doubt whether AI can make correct judgments when face unexpected or malicious user input, especially from minors, when users ask for violent or pornographic images, is the AI reliable enough to limit or inform the user that this is not what the AI is intended for. In addition, art competition intent for human competes, so the participation of artificial intelligence is meaningless, which also makes the evaluation and review unreliable. What is more, artificial intelligence requires artists' works as a reference for learning, it is unfair to artists that hides their potential contributions and efforts.
>
> For Jack's part, he mainly expounded from the perspective of project sponsor. In his opinion, if the code or model is biased and unfair in terms of gender, age, race, for example when keywords is "military", the AI drawing will mostly output male characters. It will affect the result of machine learning and cause some contradictions in society. This bias mainly caused by the unbalanced distribution of real data in the dataset. Providing more data or removing these biases by utilizing specific strategies in advance is the best way of prejudice reduction.
>
> For my part, I discuss from the perspective of philosophers and focus on the attribution of the artworks. When a user uses AI and makes some modifications, whether the artwork should be regarded as the creation of AI or the creation of the user. Suppose we use the method which shown in this video to create an artwork, although the actual painter is AI, the user provides most of the composition ideas and AI only help the user finish the work more quickly, it is unfair for user to define AI is the attribution of the artwork. Therefore, it is necessary to set a modification magnitude to define the attribution problem of creating by AI or user.
>
> Next part is the similar technologies and our team focus on the code generating AI which is relatively mature. It aims to promise to cut development costs while allowing coders to focus on creative, less repetitive tasks. For users, it reduces the need for some repetitive work and avoid some human error. However, Excessive convenience will also lead to user dependency, if the user is a beginner programming, then overuse will lead to their programming ability decline and weak grasp of some programming basics. For developer of code AI, this technique has some security issues. Since much of the training AI's code comes from code hosting platforms like GitHub, it may exist the possibility of a loophole that unintentional vulnerabilities from outdated code or intentional ones injected by malicious actors into the training set. Therefore, developer will be necessary to pre-screen and check the code before training.

**Conduct research on how similar technology has been used. Pick two of the issues or concerns in relation to the technology that were discussed by the stakeholders, which might include fairness, transparency, explain ability, and/or responsibility issues, ethical and/or discrimination risks. Provide critical analysis on its impact with examples from similar or related real-world technologies. [1000 words]**

> Code Generate AI 
>
> > One similar technology is code-generating AI. For the present stage of this technology, no widely available AI system can generate programs with complex logic. It is more inclined to machines that assist pair programming, which generally works by auto-completing portions of code written by a user or taking instructions describing the code generated. It aims to promise to cut development costs while allowing coders to focus on creative, less repetitive tasks. The most advanced example of these systems is Copilot from GitHub. It is not only chosen by some international enterprises on complex projects but also as an extension plugin that all individual users can use on VSCode, Jetbrain and other coder editors or IDE. Copilot can finish small snippets of code or write functions that perform simple tasks based on a prompt described by the user. It assists human programmers by reducing the time it takes to develop routine functionality. 
> >
> > Code-generating AI is similar to drawing AI. The group of stakeholders mainly include the user and developer. The user group can also be divided into individual and project managers. For individual users, it reduces the need for some repetitive work and avoids some users' errors, such as spelling and incorrect characters. It is also beneficial for beginner programming. It can provide example code that follows the users' requirements. However, everything has two sides, excessive convenience will also lead to user dependency, especially for the beginner programmer, and overuse will lead to their programming ability decline and a weak grasp of some programming basics. 
> >
> > For project manager users, this tool can significantly reduce the necessary repetitive work and reduce bugs or problems caused by individual carelessness to shorten the project completion time and total cost. When a project has a problem with the code generated by AI, the attribution of the problem is the user, as this technology is only an auxiliary role. Users have the responsibility to ensure that the code generated by AI the requirements of the project and the current environment.
> >
> > For the developer, similar to drawing AI bias due to the unbalanced distribution of actual data in the dataset, code-generating AI also has security issues due to the training samples' uncertain safety. Since much of the training AI's code comes from code hosting platforms like GitHub, there may be a loophole in unintentional vulnerabilities from outdated code or intentional ones injected by malicious actors into the training set. It may cause an unintentional attack on the computer or service while running code. In addition, code-generating AI's goal is broader than the current assistive nature but rather to be more autonomous in completing code and independent projects without human guidance. The improvement of code-generating AI may inadvertently and rapidly create new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities beyond our ability to discover and harden them.
> >
> > Moreover, whether humans or machines write code is inherently dual use. Because this technology is available to all, it will help programmers do their jobs better while increasing the speed with which cyber attackers can find vulnerabilities and develop attack tools. Code-generating AI creates many new opportunities and conveniences but presents some technical challenges. Therefore, developers need to pre-screen the training code before training and update AI based on code or library updates to avoid the risk of introducing known vulnerabilities or learning AI to rewrite those integrations to reduce the time of updating and narrowing the window of vulnerability. Additional rules also need to be set to stop allowing AI to be used as a tool for attackers.
