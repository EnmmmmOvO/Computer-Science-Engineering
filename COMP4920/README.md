  Here is a very thorough reading - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/ Please do not feel obligated to read all of this unless unless you are super curious about the wider cosmology of meta-ethics. Having said that, it would be realyl wonderful if all of you gave it a try! It will be easier after you watch the video above : )
